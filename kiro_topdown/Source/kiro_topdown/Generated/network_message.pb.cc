// Simplified protobuf implementation for UE integration
// Generated from network_message.proto

#include "network_message.pb.h"

// This file is intentionally minimal since all functionality
// is implemented inline in the header file for simplicity.
// In a full protobuf implementation, this would contain
// serialization/deserialization code, but for our UE integration
// we only need the basic structure and accessors.
