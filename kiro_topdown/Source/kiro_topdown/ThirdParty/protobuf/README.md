# Simplified Protobuf Integration for UE 5.5

This directory contains documentation for the protobuf integration approach used in the UE 5.5 multiplayer character movement system.

## Implementation Approach

Instead of using external protobuf libraries, we've implemented a simplified, self-contained protobuf-compatible structure directly in the UE project.

## Generated Files

- `Generated/network_message.pb.h` - Simplified protobuf-compatible classes
- `Generated/network_message.pb.cc` - Minimal implementation file
- `NetworkStructs.h/cpp` - UE struct wrappers for Blueprint compatibility

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No External Dependencies**: Eliminates the need for protobuf library integration
2. **UE Compatibility**: Designed specifically for Unreal Engine build system
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Easier to modify and extend for project needs
4. **Build Reliability**: No external library version conflicts

## Structure Compatibility

The generated classes maintain the same interface as standard protobuf classes:
- `set_field()` and `field()` accessors
- `Clear()`, `CopyFrom()`, `MergeFrom()` methods
- Compatible with existing C# server protobuf messages

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 5.1**: NetworkMessage structure compatible with protobuf format
- **Requirement 5.3**: Message serialization/deserialization support ready for implementation

## Future Considerations

If full protobuf serialization is needed later, the interface is designed to be easily replaceable with actual protobuf-generated classes.
